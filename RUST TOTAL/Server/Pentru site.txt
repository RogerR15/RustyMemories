Salut eu sunt Robert, un baiat care studiaza la Mate-Info. Am ales acest domeniu de studiu pentru că am fost întotdeauna interesat de calculatoare. Sunt in acest Staff si ma simt pregatit de ati raspunde la orice intrebare pe discord.

RustyMemories was created by Sebi with the simple thought of making a Rust server and then a larger community where players from all over the world can play. 

The Rust servers were designed with how Sebi liked to play the game and the RustyMemories site was made and designed by Robert. Players can give feedback on ways and to be able to make this community the best in the world.

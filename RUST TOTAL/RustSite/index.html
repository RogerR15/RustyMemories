            <h1>About Server</h1>
            <p class="text">
                RustyMemories was created by <span>Sebi</span> with the simple thought of making a Rust server and then
                a larger community where players from all over the world can play.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The Rust servers were designed with how Sebi liked to play the game and the RustyMemories site was made
                and designed by <span>Robert.</span> Players can give feedback on ways and to be able to make this
                community the best in the world.

                <p>For starters, my name is Sebastian, I'm creative, sociable, I like to joke and laugh. I like to
                    listen to interesting things that someone tells me, I don't get bored so easily and on top of that,
                    when you are in a company with me, you will never get bored, because I am very energetic and always
                    prone to heat up the atmosphere. In the end I decided to open this community and I have since done
                    something beautiful!</p>
